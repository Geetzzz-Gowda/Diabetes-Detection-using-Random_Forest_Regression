# Diabetes-Detection-using-Random_Forest_Regression
ML based Diabetes Detector
The machine learning-based diabetes detector using Random Forest Regression analyzes medical data to predict diabetes risk with high accuracy. This method aggregates the results of multiple decision trees, each trained on different subsets of the data, to create a robust and reliable predictive model. Key features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels are used to train the model on historical patient data, identifying patterns indicative of diabetes. The trained model can then predict the likelihood of diabetes for new patients, facilitating early detection and intervention. This approach is particularly effective due to its ability to manage complex datasets and reduce the likelihood of overfitting, making it a valuable tool for healthcare professionals.
